This is an __unnoficial LaTeX teplate__ for presentations given by people from ICRAR.

The template created with a quick and dirty attitude, thus the style file not constructed well and do not specify everithing, only some basic enviroments. For some tricky LaTeX presentations, one have to modify the style file to get acceptable looking slides, but using simple slides the template works well. See the style slides for some details!

Dark theme is coming ...
